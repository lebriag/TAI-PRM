Description: Diagram shows the higher level diagram based on the ISO 31000.
Outcomes: Each run of the diagram will go throughout several flowcharts with the end goal of perform an overall Risk Management Process over each of the AI assets defined by the user
Activities: 
   - AI Confirmation: Identify the Ai assets in the system.
   - E-risk identification and classification: Classify the intrinsik level of risk of the AI artefacts --- This is an extended flowchart
   - AI modification: First layer of identification if the AI asset can be modifed in order to avoid the unacceptable risk level condition.
   - AI scope Definition: Check which are the most relevant requirements from the Trustworthy AI requirements list to be implemented in the AI asset. --- This is an extended flowchart
   - Analysis of Values: If values, additional to the Trustworhty requirements, want to be considered in the analyses.  --- This is an extended flowchart.
   - e-risk  Management: The process of identifying failure modes and define corrective actions based on the risks analyses performed over the AI. --- This is an extended flowchart.
