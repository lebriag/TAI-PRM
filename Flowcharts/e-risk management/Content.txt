Description: The process of identifying failure modes and define corrective actions based on the risks analyses performed over the AI.
Outcomes: Identification of risk, recomencdations for risk treatment and metrics to track them.
Activities: 
   - Establishing context: Define for each artefact their connectivity, human agency, constraings, hierarchy, diagrams, requirements, and values
   - Risk analysis and evaluation: Perform e-risk. Include risk analyses for processes and system design depending on the stage, definitions, and definitions previously defined. --- This is an extended flowchart.
   - Desing Risk Analysis: Consider running in parallel risk analysis and evaluation tools for the general design process.
   - Process Risk Analysis: Consider running in parallel risk analysis and evaluation tools for the production process.
   - Update Definitions: Include these new failure modes in the following risk analysis process in a list that includes all relevant Failure Modes  (Risk Register) and clearly defines their scope.
   - Risk Treatment, Transfer, Tolerate or Terminate: Based on the risk analyses and evaluation define the approaches to treat, transfer, tolerate or terminate the use of the AI component. --- This is an extended flowchart.
   - Estimates KPIs: Estimate the KPIs defined to keep track of the status of e-risks or risk in general if the approach in the Risk Assessment contemplates a parallel run with technical risk evaluation (Check the Risk Assessment framework for further understanding). Update the risk register with the estimated KPIs
   - Risk Register: Update the risk register with the infromation derived from the risk analyses and the risk treamtent propositions
   - Monitor: Monitor the the risk management process from previous stages and evaluate possible improvement or modifications to the process
   - Update Interactions: Restructure the connectivity wiht other components/subsystems and repet the previous processes for Risk Managment. considering the imact over external parts.
   - Update of requirements considerations: Repeat the risk managenment process including the incroporation of "Privacy and Data Governance" for modification on data, otherwise include the respective requirement.  
   - Restart: Restart the framework incorporating the new components
   - Review, update, implementation and control: Evaluate the update and status of your risk. Communica and perform consultations based on these results and any feedback derived from the risk identification process, the risk analysis, the risk evaluation, and the recommendations based on risk treatment, transfer, termination or tolerance. Define what approaches will be implemented as risk treatment.
   - Re-initiate e-Risk Identificatino and Consider Internal Audit: Re-evaluate the risk level of the AI component or, if needed, re-initiate the use of the framework with the tratments modifcations. Additinally consider implementing internal audit for evalluation the implementation of the 4T's
