Description: Perform Critical Analysis
Outcomes: Critical numbers and agglomerated analyses
Activities: 
   - Use of Probability numbers: Use the probability numbers to estimate category levels (from A to E) to estimate critical numbers. The operational time should be the same for each failure mode under consideration
   - Ocurrence Level Category: Estimate occurrence level category (from A to E) based on expert judgment regarding system/sub-system/component fixed operational times. The operational time should be the same for each failure mode under consideration.
   - Critical Number based on Classification: Use the Critical Evaluation based on severity and likelihood graph to estimate a relative critical number for reference.
   - Failure Effect Probability: For each failure mode: Estimate Failure rates for the severity and likelihood  classifications.
   - For each failure mode  the conditional probability of mission loss, part/component failure rate, and the duration of applicalbe mission phase
   - Failure Mode Critical Number: Estimate the failure mode critical number for each failure mode based on the given equation.
   - Agglomerate: Estimate item critical number by agglomerating the failure mode critical number.
   - Ethical KPIs: Estimate, if possible, the Ethical Critical Number and the Ethical Relative Criticality number.
   - Analysis and Hierarchy: Based on the agglomerated critical numbers, define the components with the higher intrinsic risk level. Prioritize later on the corrective actions on these items. Use tools based on decision-making or discretisation approaches (e.g. Pareto) to define the most relevant ones
