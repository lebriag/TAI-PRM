## Description:
Perform Fault Analysis by Failure Modes, Effects and Criticality Analysis
 
## Outcomes:
Failure modes identification and RPN number

## Activities: 
   - Define and Merge DFMEA/PFMEA: If the processes of DFMEA and PFMEA are new, secure the execution of the defined analysis, and develop functional blocks/diagrams. If processes are running, extend the scopes and functional diagrams to allow the combination with e-FMEA
   - Each Stage Analyses: Consider the execution of the e-FMEA approach for each of the life cycle components of the system. If not,  consider individual failure modes for each item/ component under each life cycle process.
   - PFMEA:  Consider the execution of the PFMEA (Process FMEA) in parallel.
   - Identify Ethical Failure Modes: Based on the requirements established in the e-risk identification, define the ethical considerations to be performed in the FMEA analyses. For each of them and each component of the AI system, define Failure Modes (FM) If not addressed before or incorporate new ones as needed. Each of the ethical considerations executes in parallel with the process involved in risk assessment. The conglomerate of these analyses will be defined as EFMEA (Ethical FMEA). An exemplification can be seen in the linked diagram.
   - Identify Process and/or Design Failure Modes: Define, based on the approach (process or design analysis), the failure mode of the same system, sub-system or components under the analysis of the present risk assessment. Consider also the different stages if applicable to the process and design of the system, sub-system and components.
   - Mode/Root cause occurrence analyses (O): for each of the failing conditions on each component, estimate failure mode/root cause occurrence. If using a confusion matrix, use its output in the probability ranks (e.g. see diagram). Use rating instead of probabilities if there is no method for extracting probability numbers (i.e defined as ranked system).
   - Severity Analysis (S): For each of the failures/roots conditions, evaluate the consequence/severity of a failure mode in terms of the operation, function, or system status. Consider that a failure condition may be caused by one or more failure modes and from one or more components and subcomponents. Consider if its effect is local (within the same subsystems) or global (other subsystems, and systems). 
   - Faling detection (D): Evaluate how the failure mode/root cause is detected and how the user is made aware of the failure conditions and system status. The detection can include messages, alarms, and human perception. In the case of information that exists in relation to the confusion matrix, use it for detection chance based on algorithmics. If detection is performed not locally (i.e. through external subsystems or components external to the local subsystem), consider making the risk appetite more stringent
   - Causes of Potential failure: Indication of how the failure could occur. Perform the description in terms of something that can be corrected or can be controlled. Additionally perform the decryption of the cause following an "if X occurs, then Y happens" (where X is the cause or RCA root and Y is the failure mode or the origin of the risk condition in the RCA approach specification.). 
   - Define recomendations and estimate the Risk Priority Number: Perform recommendations related to failure modes incorporation, failure compensating previsions, or modifications that could prevent, reduce, or increase the detection of the failure mode effects. RPN = failing condition rank of occurrence * S * D
   - Fill the FMEA forms: Populate the risk register . If using FMEA approach, use the FMEA form as risk register backup. 

The FMEA in the last step includes:
	1. description of item (system, subsystem, component)
	2. description of failure
	3. effects of failure
	4. cause of failure component
	5. failure detection components.
	6. RPN/PR
