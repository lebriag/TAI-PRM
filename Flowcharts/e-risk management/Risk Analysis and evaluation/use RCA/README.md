## Description:
Perform Root Cause Analyse (RCA)

## Outcomes:
Identification of risk and recomencdations.

## Activities: 
   - Scope of the RCA: Define the RCA problem as fulfilling the requirements set in e-risk identification. Furthermore, perform the data collection of relevant information that will help to run qualitative analyses, if possible. The data should be relevant for the e-risk identified based on the trustworthy components.
   - Root Cause Analysis: Perform the root cause analysis by using supporting approaches such as: (1) 5 whys, (2) Change analysis/event analysis (3) Fishbone Diagrams, (4) Fault tree analysis
   - Analysis and Recommendations: Define, with enough detail (and supporting evidence) the root cause claims, provide corrective course of actions.
   - Record Results: Populate the risk register with the analyses and recommendations obtained. Since no FMEA analysis was performed, populate only the areas related to failure modes identification, recommended actions, and explanation of the cause. Make sure to establish that the results are from an RCA analysis.
