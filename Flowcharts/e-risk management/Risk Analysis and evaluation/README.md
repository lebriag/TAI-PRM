## Description:
Perform e-risk. Include risk analyses for processes and system design depending on the stage, definitions, and definitions previously defined.

## Outcomes:
Identification of risk and recomencdations.

## Activities: 
 - Use FMEA: Perform Fault Analysis by Failure Modes, Effects and Criticality Analysis --- This is an extended flowchart.
 - Use RCA: Perform Root Cause Analyse (RCA) --- This is an extended flowchart.
 - Critical Analysis: Perform Quantitative Critical Analysis --- This is an extended flowchart.
 - Heat Map Construction:Depending if you used directly th FMEA or performed critical number calculations construct a risk matrix based on risk appetite (if not defined before). If you used a FMEA estimate their percentiles and medians (the definition of percentiles is based on he users risk appetite approach. --- Further information on its construction in the manuscript.
 - Perform Analyses: Define hierarchically what risks /failure modes are the most relevant for your system/sub-system or component.  --- This is an extended flowchart.
