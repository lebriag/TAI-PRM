Description: Classify the intrinsik level of risk of the AI artefacts --- This is an extended flowchart 
Outcomes: Intrinsic level of risk of the AI elements and what Trustworthy Requirements are needed. k Management Process over each of the AI assets defined by the user
Activities: 
   - Level of risk: Check the risk level based on AI act if possible.
   - Regulatory Check: Check if these regulations affect the AI asset current definitions. Modify the AI asset as possible to secure fulfilment of regulations. Otherwise consider the asset as Unacceptable Risk
   - Define New e-risk assessment: Define the new clusters of classification to be incorporated within the risk evaluation if new classes of risk are defined. When new regulations or identification considerations are set, define them in the Initiate Early e-risk Assessment process.
   - early e-risk assessment: Perform an early-stage AI e-risk assessment to identify your AI as an Unacceptable, High, Limited, or Low Risk--- This is an extended flowchart.
   - Consider Unacceptable Risk: Define to terminate AI asset if as an Unacceptable risk level.
   - Consider Low/Minimal Risk: Define trustworthy requirements if low or minimal risk level.
   - Consider limited risk: Define trustworthy requirements if limited risk level.
   - Consider High risk: Define trustworthy requirements if high risk level.
   - Consider New Class: Define new classes and rquirements if new classes are defined by regulations
